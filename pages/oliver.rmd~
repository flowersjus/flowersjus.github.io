### Synopsis:

> The streets of Victorian England come to life as Oliver, a malnourished orphan in a workhouse, becomes the neglected apprentice of an undertaker. Oliver escapes to London and finds acceptance amongst a group of petty thieves and pickpockets led by the elderly Fagin. When Oliver is captured for a theft that he did not commit, the benevolent victim, Mr. Brownlow takes him in. Fearing the safety of his hideout, Fagin employs the sinister Bill Sikes and the sympathetic Nancy to kidnap him back, threatening Oliverâ€™s chances of discovering the true love of a family.
>
> Oliver! is a musical theatre masterpiece, perfectly showcasing the talents of a large ensemble cast as they bring these classic characters and score to life.

### Suggested by:

Anna Carlson suggested this show:

> Rising seventh grader, Benjamin Walker, is quite a dancer and singer. He would make a convincing Artful Dodger in Oliver --- You will have a chance to watch him during the Assembly on Monday.
